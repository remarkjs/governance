# Governance

This repo will describe how [**@remarkjs**](https://github.com/remarkjs) is
governed.
We’re currently drafting that out in [unifiedjs/governance#2](https://github.com/unifiedjs/governance/issues/2).

There’s a lot of churn around handling 200 projects with many different teams.
I’m going to try and write some code to streamline that here.
